Sure, here are ten basic points about GraphQL that you can use to present to your team:

1. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by Facebook in 2012 and made open source in 2015.
2. It allows clients to request exactly what they need and nothing more, making it more efficient and reducing over-fetching.
3. With GraphQL, clients can query multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of API requests needed to fetch data.
4. GraphQL is strongly typed, meaning that the schema defines the types of data that can be queried and returned.
5. It has a powerful type system that allows for easy evolution of APIs and ensures that clients always receive the correct data format.
6. GraphQL enables front-end developers to work more independently from back-end developers, as they can specify their own data requirements.
7. It is not tied to any specific database or storage engine, and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
8. GraphQL provides a single endpoint for all queries and mutations, making it easy to test and monitor.
9. It is often used in conjunction with client-side frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular to create modern web applications.
10. GraphQL is becoming increasingly popular among developers, with major companies such as GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb adopting it for their APIs.
