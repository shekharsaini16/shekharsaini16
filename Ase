Here's a corrected version of the message:

Dear all,

Please be advised that there will be a delay of two days in the monthly refresh process. The table "CmsTRRFullEnroll" has not been refreshed yet from the CMS side, which is causing the delay. We have received confirmation from Pollock and Scott from the CMS team that CMS typically sends this information around the 3rd to the 5th of the month, or on the 1st Saturday of the month.

Unfortunately, there was a CMS server outage on Saturday, which has caused a delay in the availability of this information. We expect to receive it on Sunday, and will work to complete the refresh process as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
